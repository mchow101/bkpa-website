            <p class="lead">
                Did you know that the US Government considers the Bengali language to be a critical language for the
                future of our country? It is the 7th most spoken language in the world. For this reason and more, the US
                State Department believes in establishing relationships with the Bengali language and people for future
                development and prosperity.

                The Bengali Kids of Princeton Area -BKPA members have distinct cultural identities as American Bengalis.
                We hope our organization can help bridge the gap between American and Bengali cultures. In this rapidly
                globalizing world, it is important to forge connections across cultures and countries. BKPAâ€™s focus is
                to build these bridges in all parts of life, starting with the paths available from the popularity of
                our language. Through events, trips, and other programs we share Bengali culture with our local
                communities and maintain relationships with our friends abroad.
