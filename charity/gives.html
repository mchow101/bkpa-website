                BKPAâ€™s own charitable programs are known as BKPA Gives.
                <br><br>
                We donate kids shoes and clothes to those in need and help disadvantaged individuals create and maintain
                sustainable careers to provide for themselves and their families.

                BKPA members donated 160lbs of kids clothes in 2019, 72 pairs of kids shoes in 2013, and 86 pairs in
                2017. These were distributed in a village in West Bengal by BKPA volunteers travelling with a mobile
                health clinic.

                Since 2017 we have gathered and delivered computers with up-to-date programs and software free of cost
                to young adults in need. This helps them pursue self-directed careers from their homes. In 2018 we also
                collected 14 computers that will be sent to classrooms in need.
