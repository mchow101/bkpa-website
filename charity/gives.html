                BKPA Gives is the charitable branch of BKPA.  We donate food, clothes, shoes, technology, and funds to individuals and families in need in America, India, Bangladesh, and around the world through our clothing drives, food drives, and International Technology for Self Sufficiency programs.

				Through these programs we assist individuals and families with immediate obstacles and help them create and maintain sustainable careers.  BKPA Gives also oversees our fundraising partnerships with organizations such as the Poets Foundation, organizes participation in group events such as the <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/index.aspx">March of Dimes</a>, and puts on free performances in assisted living facilities.
				
                <!--BKPA members donated 160lbs of kids clothes in 2019, 72 pairs of kids shoes in 2013, and 86 pairs in
                2017. These were distributed in a village in West Bengal by BKPA volunteers travelling with a mobile
                health clinic.
                <br><br>
                Since 2017 we have gathered and delivered computers with up-to-date programs and software free of cost
                to young adults in need. This helps them pursue self-directed careers from their homes. In 2018 we also
                collected 14 computers that will be sent to classrooms in need.-->
