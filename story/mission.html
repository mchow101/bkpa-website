                BKPA stands for The Bengali Kids of Princeton Area. As American Bengali kids and young adults, our goals
                are to pursue higher education, establish ourselves as good citizens, and give back to and support our
                local and global communities.

                Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world. As an organization, our mission is to learn about
                and expose others to our Bengali culture, engage with our communities, and grow as individuals. Along
                with celebrating both our American and Bengali cultures, we also work to stay informed about social
                issues prominent in society.
                <br><br>
                To support this mission our organization has four pillars: Educational, Cultural, Literary, and
                Charitable.
