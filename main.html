            <p class="lead">
                BKPA stands for The Bengali Kids of Princeton Area. As American Bengali kids and young adults, our goals
                are to pursue higher education and establish ourselves as good citizens, giving back to and supporting
                our local and global communities.
				<br><br>
                We work to further these goals in four areas: Educational, Cultural, Literary, and Charitable. We
                organize annual cultural events, Bengali Language and Heritage classes, and community service
                initiatives. <a href="#contact">Contact us</a> to learn more or get involved!
