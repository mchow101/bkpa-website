            <p class="lead">
                BKPA stands for The Bengali Kids of Princeton Area. As American Bengali kids and young adults, our goals are to pursue higher
                education, establish ourselves as good citizens, and give back to and support our local and global communities.
                Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world. As an organization, our mission is to learn about and
                expose others to our Bengali culture, engage with our communities, and grow as individuals. Along with celebrating
                both our American and Bengali cultures, we also work to stay informed about social issues prominent in society.
                To support this mission our organization has four pillars: Educational, Cultural, Literary, and Charitable.
