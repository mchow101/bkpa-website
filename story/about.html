            <p class="lead">
                BKPA has four pillars around which we structure our activities: Educational, Charitable, Literary, and
                Cultural. We host events, classes, fundraisers, and more to support goals in each of these areas.
                <br><br>
                As a volunteer-run organization for kids, our programs are generated by and focused on kids.

                BKPA was founded in the early 2000s by Anita Dam. Anita was inspired to create a community where she
                could learn about, celebrate, and share her heritage and connect with other Bengali and Bengali-American
                kids. This drive to forge cultural connections has led to BKPA blossoming into an international
                community. BKPA started at Anitaâ€™s kitchen table as a club holding a few annual events and a weekly
                informal Bangla class, and has now grown to host multiple events per year with a community around the
                globe.
